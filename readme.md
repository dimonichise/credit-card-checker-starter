# Credit Card Checker
The program checks if credit card numbers are valid or not.
### Short description
* Look over the starter code. There are 15 arrays that each contain the digits of separate credit card numbers. They all have prefixes to reflect their status, i.e. variables that start with valid contain a valid number, whereas invalid do not, and mystery variables can be either. There is also a batch array that stores all of the provided credit cards in a single array.
* Implementation of the "Moon" algorithm
* Returning an array with invalid numbers
* Returning an array with companies that issued invalid cards
